## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

While building this application, I learned how to:

Implement basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.
Use event listeners to handle user input.
Manipulate the DOM to update the UI based on user input.





### Continued development

There are several ways to improve this application, such as:

- Implementing more advanced math operations, such as trigonometric functions.
- Improving the UI design to make it more visually appealing.
- Adding keyboard support for users who prefer to use their keyboard instead of clicking buttons.

### Useful resources

Here are some resources that I found helpful while building this application:

- MDN Web Docs - a comprehensive resource for web developers.
- W3Schools - another great resource for learning web development.
- JavaScript.info - a detailed guide to JavaScript.
